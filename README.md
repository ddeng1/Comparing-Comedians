## Stand-up Comedy Analysis
### Overview
This project is an analysis of comedy specials by some top comedians and compares and contrasts the different styles each of the comedians uses. The analysis involves a look at a count of unique words, pace of their comedy special and a sentiment analysis of each of the comedian's transcripts.

### Installation and use
The python packages and libraries that I used in this project were textblob, pandas, matplotlib, numpy, requests, scitlearn and BeautifulSoup.Most of them come included in anaconda. If you do not use anaconda, you can install the packages separately.

* Install [anaconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/linux/).
* To install textblob run the following on your terminal:
``` conda install -c conda-forge textblob ```
* Clone the repo (https://github.com/ddeng1/comparing-comedians.git)
* cd into the clone repo on your terminal
* Open jupyter notebook on the terminal using ``` jupyter notebook  ```
* Open the computational analysis and essay file and run the contents of the file.
