### Stand-up Comedy Analysis
### Overview
#### This project is an analysis of comedy specials by some top comedians and compares and contrasts the different styles each of the comedians uses. The analysis involves a look at a count of unique words, pace of speech and a sentiment analysis of each of the comedian's transcripts 

### Installation and use
#### The python packages and libraries that I used in this project were textblob, pandas, matplotlib, numpy, requests, scitlearn and BeautifulSoup. You can import most the them on each python file you create. To install textblob run the following on the the terminal:
``` conda install -c conda-forge textblob ```
